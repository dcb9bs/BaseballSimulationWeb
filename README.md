* On update Roster page only players with either pitcher or batter data are displayed
  * should players be allowed to be created without data?
* creating a player on a team that already exists givens a django error needs to be handled
* models for Simulation
* error checking on Running a simulation to prevent players without data being in the lineup
* Updating player data
  * API
  * Front End input
* Improve displaying of all players/teams
* Build searching for both players and teams
  * messages to prevent duplicate teams
* When creating players form data is not reset could potentially create invalid data for other new players
